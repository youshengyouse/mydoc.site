## Overview

You'll have to configure i18n routing on your React framework and Fumadocs.

Fumadocs is not a full-powered i18n library, it's up to you when internationalizing the rest of your app.
You can also use other libraries with Fumadocs like [next-intl](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl) on Next.js.
